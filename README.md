Shallow
=======

Deep learning approaches to the M/EEG inverse problem. Shallow allows 
simulation of source space data (i.e., cortical activity) and sensor space data
(i.e., M/EEG recordings), and then uses neural networks to learn the mapping 
between these two spaces. Shallow can iterate over multiple NN architectures 
and parameters (using Keras and config files).
